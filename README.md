 <hr>


**drinksa*pH*e** is a project developed during the IoT course. The core functionality of this project is to monitor the pH level of drinking water in various water coolers in the Computer Centre 2 of IIIT Allahabad.

“DrinkSapHe©” aims to improve the efficiency of water cooler maintenance process, starting with water coolers of CC3, and perhaps later expanding to the other water coolers of the campus of IIIT-Allahabad. Real-time reporting of water quality levels will reduce the time it takes to regularly check the quality manually. The in-built reporting feature makes it easier for students to report problems to the maintenance team.
